GMMV-LIM
========

Introduction
------------

GMMV-LIM is a MATLAB-based package of the **Linear Inversion Method based on the Generalized Multiple Measurement Vectors model**. This package inverts the [Fresnel data](http://www.fresnel.fr/3Ddatabase/) with multiple frequency components. In addition, it also contains the linear sampling method (LSM). Comparison can be easily made to verify the advantage of GMMV-LIM.
